Privacy policies are boring and hard to read. And most of them wouldnâ€™t survive a competent legal challenge.

So, Iâ€™ve ditched the templates and written my own privacy policy.

## Summary for humans

- Iâ€™m Paul Nebel and Iâ€™m the data controller for this site.
- I do not use cookies (see below) for anything. Full stop.
- I wonâ€™t spam you or sell or share your personal data.
- I donâ€™t use the Facebook Pixel to annoy you with ads for the rest of your life.
- My site uses HTTPS/SSL security.

## General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)

Most people have heard of the **GDPR**, the updated set of data-protection rules that become enforceable on 25 May 2018.

You may have heard that the GDPR means you have to give your explicit consent before being signed up to receive marketing communications. Thatâ€™s a good thing but the GDPR is about more than that.

Briefly, you also have the right to:

- **LEARN** how your data is being used.
- **REQUEST** that your data is deleted.
- **RETRIEVE** your data in a format you can read and re-use elsewhere.

## Cookies

Cookies are simple text files that your web browser uses to record some settings relevant to each website you visit.

I donâ€™t use cookies at all. For anything.

This is because I don't use Google Analytics to monitor website activity. Instead, I use [Plausible](https://plausible.io/)

> Plausible is a lightweight and open-source website analytics tool. No cookies and fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR. Made and hosted in the EU ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º

Unlike Google Analytics, Plausible site measurement is carried out absolutely anonymously. Cookies are not used and no personal data is collected. There are no persistent identifiers. No cross-site or cross-device tracking either. Your site data is not used for any other purposes.

## Collecting personal information

The only personal information I collect is your email address, should you choose to email me. I only do this so that I can communicate with you:

I donâ€™t sell, trade or share your personally identifiable information.
