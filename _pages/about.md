## Paul Nebel - MEng PhD MBCS ![BCS Professional Member logo]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/mbcs-logo-colour-small.jpg)

I am a freelance Virtual CTO specialising in technology leadership, product development and strategic analysis. I make technology work to serve the  business by aligning technical requirements with strategy. I help companies to maximise operational efficiency by designing and implementing products to improve business performance and reduce costs through better use of technology. I can help you achieve your goals of productivity, efficiency and delivery.

I have been a professional developer for over 20 years. Â I have occupied a variety of roles in that time, from developer to team lead to technical architect and consultant. The projects I have been involved in cover a wide range of technologies including (but not limited to) the following:

* Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript
* React, Redux
* Next.js, Gatsby.js
* RESTful APIs
* Microservices
* Containerisation
* Continuous delivery
* Minimum Viable Product development
* Distributed computing
* Graph databases (Neo4j, OrientDB)
* SQL & NoSQL databases (MySQL, SQLServer, MongoDB)
* Object-orientation (Java, C#, Ruby, Smalltalk)
