> From the earliest stages of the rigorous selection process for us to join the Geovation programme through to appointment of our CTO, Paul has been brilliant. He has helped us live the lean startup approach, guiding us from concept to minimum viable product to a software product now being used by hundreds of people. Despite the multiple demands on his time he's remained clear, thoughtful, patient and whenever necessary, suitably challenging. We cannot recommend Paul highly enough.
