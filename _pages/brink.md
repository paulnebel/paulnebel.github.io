> I've worked with Paul on a unusual and challenging project at the intersection of climate science, business, art and technology. Throughout, Paul has been an invaluable member of the team. He has calmly guided us through the design and delivery of our first product and has helped us in refining our business proposition and go-to-market strategy. Amongst his many skills, I've been particularly impressed by his ability to interpret some of our more abstract and wooly ideas and feedback and turn them into concrete actions!
