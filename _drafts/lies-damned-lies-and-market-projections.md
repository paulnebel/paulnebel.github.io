Had a startup that was looking at renting empty properties at last minute for lower prices.  Said that x% of properties were empty at any one time, and they intended to increase utilisation by y%.  When I asked them how they calculated this figure they said they looked at the number of days booked vs number of days not booked.  But did you account for variations in demand? They looked at me blankly.  Did you look at when they were booked compared to when other properties were booked?  In other words, did you normalise the data by accounting for peak demand?  Ummm.... no.

Typical stat is as follows: Overall market share is £Xbn, of which £Ybn are our demographic.  Assumption is, therefore, that market potential is £Ybn so invest in us.  Well, yes, market share may be £ybn but that doesn't mean you'll get any of it.  Lazy to assume that a figure implies an outcome without looking at it in detail.

Cognitive bias

This is why hypotheses and experiments are so important
