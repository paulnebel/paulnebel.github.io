# What's the point of a Prototype?

> sub dfgsdfg dfgsdfg. sdfgsdfg

my job is basically to create working first versions of products that unlock investment

Don't like MVP (invariably neither M, nor V, nor P!)

Why Prototype?

  - Act before you have all the answers
  - Test and explore an idea
  - Sell your idea
  - Incremental progress in complex projects
  - Avoid wasting time on the wrong things, fail early
  - Communication & collaboration

Prototypes will not:
  
   - Create your full product faster
   - Magically and mysteriously remove all the leg-work involved in making robust, secure products
   - Be of any use whatsoever unless you are laser-focused on the hypothesis they are trying to validate
