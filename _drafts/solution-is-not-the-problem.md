# The Solution is not the problem.  The Problem is the problem.

When it comes to building a business, solutions are not the issue (yes, I know this is a very broad statement but in my experience it is largely true). When it comes to technical solutions, this is especially so.  There aree 1001 different ways of creating a solution for any given problem.  The challenge is to **understand the problem well enough to choose an appropriate solution**.

As a result, we primarily use the Value Proposition Canvas to explore how deeply the startup understands the problem they are trying to solve. Once we have established that we are in a much stronger position to help them solve it.
