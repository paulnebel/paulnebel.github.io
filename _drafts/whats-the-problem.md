You have identified a problem.  What is a problem?  It's something that causes some form of pain.  Pains can loosely be categorised as follows:
 
 1. **Absence** The simply doesn't appear to be a way of doing something that you want to do.
 2. **Inefficiency** There is a way of doing something but it takes more time or effort that you want to spend.
 3. **Cost** There is a way of doing something but you can't afford it (either because you simply don't have the money or because the cost isn't justified by the outcome).
 4. **Error** There is a way of doing something but the answer isn't right.
 5. **Incomplete** There is a way of doing something but it only does part of what you want it to do.
 6. **Inappropriate** There is a way of doing something but the result/output is in a form that is hard/impossible to use.
