Strapline: considered 'Building Successful Business', but aliteration of 'Building Better Business' appealed more (although not keen on association with 'Build Back Better', but perhaps that will be to my advantage?

Current network: 323 connections
Average monthly profile views: 20-30
Average weekly search appearances: 15-25 (most used keyword for search = 'senior software engineer' - I want this to change)

Advice from: https://espirian.co.uk/linkedin-starter-guide/

Success = Average monthly profile views > 40 (i.e. 30% increase)

## [5 minute branding](https://espirian.co.uk/5-minute-branding/)

Paul Nebel is the Virtual CTO building better business.

### Open Book
If I find something interesting, I'll share it. I don't hold back information.

While my insights are my own everything else is based on the work of others.  It's not mine to keep.

### Focus Finder
Many business issues arise due to a lack of clarity.

Clarity requires focus, and I help people find the focus that brings clarity.

### Keepin' it real
Business/technology needn't be dull or abstract.

There are plenty of concrete examples out there. Use them.

I have a sense of humour. Use it.

### Building Better Business
Problem first, customer second, solution third.

Always.

### Triple Bottom Line

People and planet before profit.

I have no problem with profit, but it's not an end in itself. If I can help society and the environment by creating a viable business then I've succeeded.

# Paul Nebel
You're an entrepreneur. You have an idea, a start-up, or an established business. You want to create a killer product or service but you're stuck with what to do next and how best to do it.

I GET IT
Innovation is HARD. Doing it by yourself is HARDER.

That's why I'm here.
I've helped 50+ start-ups üí•Build Better Businessüí• and I can help you do the same.

WHAT I DO
‚úÖ Make innovation possible by reducing uncertainty, achieving focus and progressing through learning
‚úÖ Optimise effective execution by reducing cost through experimentation and better use of technology
‚úÖ Make technology work to serve the business by aligning technical requirements with business strategy
‚úÖ Help you achieve your goals of productivity, efficiency and delivery

TECHNICAL LEADERSHIP AND IMPLEMENTATION
One of the keys to success is to understand where you are and where you need to be, which are often two very different things. As a VIRTUAL CTO & SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER I help startups get where they need to go in the most efficient and effective way.

It's tempting for tech businesses to provide tech answers to every question. I believe that a good CTO identifies and builds only what cannot be purchased and only if it is absolutely necessary.

I‚Äôm interested in creating shiny new businesses, not just playing with shiny new technology.

BUSINESS DESIGN
My experience gained from working with over 50 early-stage technology startups has defined an effective approach for reducing uncertainty and achieving clarity. As a WORKSHOP FACILITATOR I create such things as:

 - Customer Personas/empathy maps
 - Value Propositions
 - Assumptions & Hypotheses
 - Business Canvasses
 - Unit Economics
 - Service Design Blueprints

All of these tools help reduce uncertainly and achieve clarity. I ask the questions that founders can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to ask of themselves but which must be asked to avoid costly mistakes or delays.
