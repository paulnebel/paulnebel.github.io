Strapline: considered 'Building Successful Business', but aliteration of 'Building Better Business' appealed more (although not keen on association with 'Build Back Better', but perhaps that will be to my advantage?

Current network: 323 connections
Average monthly profile views: 20-30 (now up to 45, so this is a success)
Average weekly search appearances: 15-25 (most used keyword for search = 'senior software engineer' - I want this to change) (slightly down at 12, but I need to game this a little more. Fail)

Advice from: https://espirian.co.uk/linkedin-starter-guide/

Success = Average monthly profile views > 40 (i.e. 30% increase)

Paul Nebel is the Virtual CTO & Business Advisor building better business.

### Open Book
If I find something interesting, I'll share it. I don't hold back information.

While my insights are my own everything else is based on the work of others.  It's not mine to keep.

### Focus Finder
Many business issues arise due to a lack of clarity.

Clarity requires focus, and I help people find the focus that brings clarity.

### Keepin' it real
Business/technology needn't be dull or abstract.

There are plenty of concrete examples out there. Use them.

I have a sense of humour. Use it.

### Building Better Business
Problem first, customer second, solution third.

Always.

### Triple Bottom Line

People and planet before profit.

I have no problem with profit, but it's not an end in itself. If I can help society and the environment by creating a viable business then I've succeeded.
