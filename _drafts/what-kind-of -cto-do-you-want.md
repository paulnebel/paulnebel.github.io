# What kind of CTO do you want?

Startups often ask us to help them choose a CTO.

Just a glorified developer, or someone who can help your business grow?  Write down all the responsibilites in your organisastion and allocate roles to them.  Who will fulfil these roles? What is your definition of CTO? Do you want them to be a developer too?
