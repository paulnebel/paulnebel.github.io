# Introduction
There have been a great many articles and blog posts in the past few months trumpeting the arrival of [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/) and lavishing praise on all it is capable of. Indeed, I've published [one]({% post_url 2016-08-16-10-stupid-questions-docker-swarm %}) or [two]({% post_url 2016-08-23-hypriotos-swarm-raspberry-pi-cluster %}) myself in the last couple of months.
