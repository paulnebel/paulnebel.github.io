Design the entire service.  Focus on what, not how. Assume your product doesn't exist. Can you provide your service just using OTS components (even for a short time)? If so, do it now and build for scale.  If not, where does the flow break down? You've just identified your unique technical value.  Most people, once they have an inkling of a problem, jump straight to the solution.  This means that their entire business ends up serving the technology, rather than technology being used to achieve the aims of the business (reference experience with LairVue here).
