Startup done a lot of work driving visitors to website but didn't know how many of then would pay, and how much.  Most startups need millions of customers (with a tiny margin on each) so if they can't afford to lose a few tens of thousands of them they're in trouble.  Make a page that says 'buy our thing for £X' (and maybe another for £Y & £Z). When they click on link, record it and send them to a page giving an excuse and asking for an email to let them know when available.  Number of clicks will tell you how much prepared to pay, number of emails left will tell you how badly they need the issue resolved.

Lie to them.  If they don't like it you have to be able to lose them.
