# Tips for workshop facilitators

## Assume you know nothing (even better, actually know nothing!)

The hardest thing about running a VP session Is that you must leave your preconceptions at home. It is best if you know nothing at all about the business idea you are testing.

## Let them talk

Most startups haven’t thought in detail about the jobs to be undertaken by their clients/customers.  When we ask them what the jobs are they tend to unload all of their ideas at once, in no particular order. As a result, the best thing to do is to just write everything down in no particular order and put it on the board without worrying too much whether it makes any sense.

After a while they will begin to run out of steam.  This is the point to take a look at what you’ve collected so far and take an initial pass at sorting it into something logical.  Chances are that this will not work!  Don’t be afraid to call a halt at this point and start again.  Take all of the post-it’s you’ve collected so far and put them at the edge of the board so that you don’t forget anything essential but go back to the beginning and be a little more rigorous in your questioning.  Now that the startups have completed their brain-dump you can start to hold them to account more.  You may have to go back to the beginning several times before they understand that you want a linear description of the task, not just a series of random facts.

Startups nearly always (vastly) underestimate the amount of detail required when mapping the problem domain

The jobs/pains/gains they are not targeting are important to understand in order not to over-promise (and disappoint customers) and to create a roadmap for introducing pain relievers/gain creators at a future date.

## Too many cooks spoil the broth

It is vitally important to limit the number of participants in a VP session.  Preferably no more than 3. There are two main problems with too many people. The first is that they don’t play nicely (talk over each other, disagree, spend ages reaching consensus).  The second is that, even if they play nicely it is too easy to be dragged off the point.  E.g. Trusted Data Hub: when asking questions with the intention of clarifying a point it is too easy for other people to jump in and qualify the answer being given, which often ends up dragging the facilitator away from the point causing them to forget what they were asking.  Also, end up arguing amongst themselves rather than answering a point.

## The Solution is not the problem.  The Problem is the problem.

When it comes to building a business, solutions are not the issue (yes, I know this is a very broad statement but in my experience it is largely true). When it comes to technical solutions, this is especially so.  There aree 1001 different ways of creating a solution for any given problem.  The challenge is to **understand the problem well enough to choose an appropriate solution**.

As a result, we primarily use the Value Proposition Canvas to explore how deeply the startup understands the problem they are trying to solve. Once we have established that we are in a much stronger position to help them solve it.
