# Am I Investable?

I recently attended an event hosted by the British Computing Society Entrepreneurs Specialist Group entitled **How Can You Get Funding to Grow Your Start-up?**. The first speaker was **[Russell Dalgleish][russelldalgliesh]**. His introduction was intriguing: he stood at the front of the audience and asked:

> Am I Investable?

The resulting silence was deafening, so he invited the audience to ask him a question. After each question from the audience he repeated his initial query:

> Am I Investable?

What he was doing (very effecitvely) was to get us to think about **how much and what sort of information does an investor need before deciding to invest in your idea?**

His answer was simple and you've probably heard it before, but it bears repeating:

> As little as possible delivered as clearly as possible.

In fact, the key requirement is **clarity** - the clearer you are the fewer words you need to explain yourself.

This is something that I think about a great deal when talking to our startups on the [Geovation Programme][geovationprogramme]. One of my responsibilities as a Senior Engineer at Geovation to interview the candidates for the Geovation Programme together with my colleagues as part of the selection process. In order to do this effectively we needed to agree on the criteria we would score the applicants against, and this set me thinking about Russell's presentation. He is approached on an almost daily basis by people looking for him to give them money to persue an idea as an investor. As a respected and successful entrepreneur his approach is of great interest to the Geovation Programme panel as we are investing both money and time in our startups.

## Clarity

Our first point of contact with the candidates is the information they provide in their applications. I'm always surprised by how poor these applications are generally given what the candidates expect to receive in return (Â£20k in funding plus business coaching and access to a professional product development team).  We had close to 100 applicants for 7 places in the round we've just finished and most of them took the same approach - use as many words as possible without actually explaining anything, as if we'd be impressed by the sheer volume of their application!

In part this is our own fault as we should have limited the number of words the candidates could use to explain their startup. The truth is that if you have 100 or so applications to review then any explanations longer than a (short) paragraph simply won't get read as we don't have the time (or the inclination). Even those that we did read were, for the most part, totally unilluminating as to the nature of the proposal they were making. If you want to be sure that your application gets read (or listened to) then I'd suggest limiting yourself to 50 words - if you can't explain it in 50 words then you probably don't understand yourself what you want to do.

This confusion is not unusual in early startups, however, so we devised an interview that gave the candidates a chance to demonstrate how well they understood their own proposal. We spent half an hour helping them complete a **Value Proposition Statement**.

**More detail here**

In completing this task we noticed some common behaviours which prevented the candidate from achieving clarity until challenged by us:

 - When asked to explain their business they responded with their **vision** rather than with their **operation**.  A classic example of this is a startup who told us that they were "ending disease in the third world". This is, of course, a very worthy aspiration but it is not a business strategy. The danger with making a statement like this is that it prevents you from being realistic about the aims and limits of what you are building. It also makes it close to impossible to prioritise development which pretty much guarantees that your startup will fail (and disease in the third world will remain unvanquished). By all means be ambitious in your values but don't confuse them with the execution of your business.
 - Being too broad in description of potential customers, not concentrating on those who will pay first
 - Using words like "Machine intelligence" or "AI" when describing product/service.  These words are meaningless. Investors actually don't care *how* you're going to provide your value, as long as you appear *credible* in your chosen field.

## Credibility
experiments and evidence

## Cooperation
teams don't matter at scale as businesses have become self-sufficient entities with processes to manage loss of team members. Even CEOs are expendable! When you're starting up, the composition of your team is critical. (add Simon Glass team evidence)
