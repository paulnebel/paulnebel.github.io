Doing VP sessions is hard.  They can be testing and tedious.  It's still worth writing stuff down for the following reasons:

 - Once it's on paper you don't have to keep it in your head (more space for other stuff)
 - You can share it (so you don't have to keep repeating yourself)
 - It's less stressful once it's done (don't risk forgetting something critical)
 - You may be surprised how much you overlook (implicit knowledge can be a bad thing)
 - Writing down what you don't solve as well as what you do makes your offering clearer (less likely for customers to be unhappy), gives you options for pivoting and future expansion
 - It challenges your thinking by making you look at the problem in a different way
 - It makes it harder to write VP statements, which can be a good thing (tempataion is to be way too verbose - we need clarity; choosing one post-it forces you to prioritise; often find that what you want to put down isn't in the VP canvas - if not, why not?)
