## TL,DR;

Market definition should be the product of all the work you have done so far to create the product or service you are delivering.

If you are uncertain which way to head, review the decisions you have made to this point and ask yourself what they tell you about your customer.

If you don't know why you made the decisions that have led you to where you are now use tools like Empathy Maps, Value Propositions and Business Models to find out.

If you are still not clear who you are selling to then you may have missed a critical step in the creation of your business. Create a Go-To-Market strategy that helps you see the wood for the trees.

## The answer lies in what is missing

Recently I've had several start-ups ask me about how to decide which of several markets they should target with their new product or service. I will admit to being slightly at sea when responding to this question initially. It's not something I've thought about directly before, which made me think that I should write a blog post about it.

### What is a go-to-market strategy?

Deciding on your **Market Definition** is the first stage in creating a Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy. As with most things business-related, defining your market and creating your GTM strategy are not necessarily linear functions. If you are having trouble defining your market it can help to consider your overall GTM strategy and working out the best approach from there.

> A go-to-market strategy generally includes a business plan that outlines how Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, Product Engineering, and product teams intend to work together to ensure growth and measure the success of your product. Typically, a GTM strategy asks a handful of questions; these questions are then answered differently depending on the growth tactic your business is implementing.
> <cite>[Molly Stovold](http://mollystovold.com/), [Build a Product That Sells Itself With Product-Led Growth](https://www.process.st/product-led-growth/)</cite>

In simple terms, a go-to-market strategy is the mechanism you use to bring a product or service to the market.

There are many sources of wisdom when it comes to creating a GTM strategy. They largely agree on the essential element of such a strategy, which are:

- **Market definition**: Who are you targeting when selling your product or service (this is the question that initiated this blog post)
- **Target audience**: Which particular customers are you focusing on within your chosen market?
- **Distribution model**: How do you propose to deliver your product or service to your chosen customer?
- **Messaging and positioning**: What is the story that is selling value to your customers and how does it differ frmo the competition?
- **Price**: How much are you going to charge and what is the cost of providing your product or service?

I was pondering these elements and wondering why it was that the start-ups I was speaking to were having such difficulty deciding which market to target. They are all headed by intelligent and motivated people, so how had they got to this point without knowing who they were selling to?

It made me think that the answer was not in what they had done to this point, but in what they may have failed to have done. In other words, the reason for being in the position they were in is down to what is missing from the picture, not what is present in the picture.

For each of the start-ups I spoke to about market definition the problem thy faced appeared to be an abundance of choice. There were so many possible customer segments that it was impossible for them to choose the best one as a starting point. What I found myself asking was:

> How have you got to this point in your development without knowing who you are selling to?

This thought was rapidly followed by another:

> If you're not sure who you are selling to, how do you know that you are solving a real problem?

Who did you have in mind when you were thinking about your product initially?

What are your long term objectives for your business?

What team do you currently have in place? If you've got a marketing team, then the options are wider.

How much money do you have to spend acquiring customers and what can you afford to buy? Remember that rabbits, deer, and elephants require different strategies and a different marketing techniques in order to reach your target audience. Going for rabbits, means that you're going to have to do a lot of online marketing, that may not be as cheap as you think Google Adwords Keyword Tool is your friend here. Remember that you're going to have to run your strategy for some time. This can run into 1000s of pounds. If you're going for elephants you're going to need some top quality sales people that are going to be expensive because they're going to work on commission. How long can you afford to wait before you raise revenue going for elephants, as a long term strategy. What connections do you have for the market. Do you have a way in the elephant.

Remember that the larger the organisation, the more people will be involved in the decision to purchase. Reference the Harvard Business School study that talked about 6.8 people involved in any purchasing decision if you're going for a big company. Do you have the time and or resources to find out who all of those people are and to engage with them. Remember that the smaller your target customer the easier it is for them to make a buying decision. The converse of that, of course, is that the more people are involved in the decision, the more valuable it is likely to be. Just remember, there is a hell of a lot more work. Reference my blog post about creating personas, and my blog post about how you talk to customers, and the different types of customers that you have to persuade large organisations.

What was the definition of your customer? Remember that the customer is the person who will pay for your product or service, not the person that is using it.

Reference the article about a back of an envelope calculation to determine how many units you have to sell in order to achieve the revenue that you're hoping to raise. That can determine your market segment. If we're talking about 10s or hundreds then you're looking at elephants or deer. If we're talking 10s of 1000s, or millions, then we're in rabbit territory.

Do you currently have any customers, and if so what sort of customers are they? What can you do to enhance your customer machine to get repeat business with a firm. If you're not happy with your current customer segments, ask yourself, why not? What is wrong? If you're not earning enough revenue should you be charging more?

What credibility, you have in the target market that you are attempting to obtain? Can you get reference customers? Can you got testimonials? What you can achieve with the money and resources at your disposal? Have you done anything like this before? Do you have marketing experience.

If you have several different customer types, and you have completed value propositions for each customer, which type offers the greatest return to the customer for the least effort on your part?

Can your chosen customers second afford to pay for what you've built, assuming that they have the problem that you're trying to solve?

What's your story? How can you persuade your chosen customer segments that they should purchase a product or service from you? The more personalised you can make your offering, the more likely it is to land. Can you do that on a large scale? Does that limit the size of the audience that you can realistically reach out to and connect with?

Have you identified a niche. If not, why not. What is stopping you from recognising who is most likely to be your customer? What's missing in your business plan? Do you have partners who can reach out for you, or which you can utilise to reach your chosen customer segment? If you don't, can you get some?

Whoever you're targeting you need to devise a campaign strategy. You're going to waste a lot of time and money if you start marketing yourself to any particular group without any idea of what your market strategy is, or what you're trying to achieve through the marketing process. Ask yourself "why am I selling to this particular group?". One of the obvious answers is going to be "because I need to generate revenue". So then the next question that immediately follows that is "how much revenue do you expect to generate from this market?".

How much do you think you're going to make. and by when? What are your milestones. What are the markers in the sand that tell you whether your strategy is working, or if you're targeting the wrong customer? There must be reasons other than revenue for why you are going for a particular customer. Maybe they're the only people who receive value from your product or service. Remember that the key to this is the value that you are adding; how much, to whom and how quickly will they see it?

How can you explain the value to them in a way that makes sense, makes them want to buy from you? But maybe you have other requirements from your campaign, maybe you want a blue chip recommendation. Maybe you want repeat business. Maybe you just want immediate revenue. All of those things are going to change your go to market strategy. And unfortunately, there is no one size fits all.  There's no simple answer to this.  Like so many things there is a process, but you have to go through the process and ask yourself sometimes difficult questions.

Do you already have a list of prospects, or indeed customers? If you already have customers and you're still worried about your market segment, ask yourself what it is about your current customers that is not answering the question that you set yourself when you acquired them. What can you do to change that, if anything? If you don't have customers already then do you have a list of prospects? If you don't have a list of prospects, make one.

Now, think of who your ideal customers might be. Take a look at people who were already paying to solve the problem. Either by buying an inferior product or service, or in some other way. Perhaps they're developing internally. Try reaching out to the potential customers on your prospect list. Are you getting a response? Is your message landing with any of them? What do they have in common, if anything? What are your realistic chances of obtaining that particular customer? If you don't know, build an experiment to find out.

If you're still struggling, hire a copywriter. A copywriter is likely to ask you all sorts of really awkward questions that you may not have asked yourself, or may find too hard to deal with by yourself. In order to write the copy that you need to sell your product or service, they're going to have to know who you're selling it to, and why, and what the advantage is to the customer. They're also likely to have more experience than you in the different methods, difficulties and costs of reaching that particular type of audience. Don't feel you have to do it all yourself.

All right, let's start at the beginning. Hopefully you created a persona for each of your customers. If not, see my blog post on how to create your persona. Ask yourself "how many of this type of person exist?". You don't need an exact number (and you're unlikely to get one), but probably have a gut feel for whether there are 1, 10, 100 or 1,000,000 of them.  Work in orders of magnitude.

Take this as a starting point. Clarity with everything is the key. Have you clearly defined the value that you're giving to this individual? How much value are you giving? a small amount, or is it a lot, because that's going to determine how much they are likely to pay for it, which is also a good indicator of the kind of market, you should be aiming for.

Take a look at your business model, what routes to market have you identified? What partners do you have, what key resources are in place, or which are missing? How long is it going to take you to get the missing pieces? What can you do with what you have? Which market can you obtain 80% of for 20% of effort?

How are you going to access your market; Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn? Have you tried any of those routes?How did you get on, was it easy? If not, give it a try, find out. Don't be too afraid of making mistakes, and potentially alienating customers through an unrefined or inappropriate approach. Chances are you're always going to lose customers, no matter what you do, so use the opportunity to learn.
