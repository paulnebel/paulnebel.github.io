# Let them talk

Most startups haven’t thought in detail about the jobs to be undertaken by their clients/customers.  When we ask them what the jobs are they tend to unload all of their ideas at once, in no particular order.  As a result, the best thing to do is to just write everything down in no particular order and put it on the board without worrying too much whether it makes any sense.

After a while they will begin to run out of steam.  This is the point to take a look at what you’ve collected so far and take an initial pass at sorting it into something logical.  Chances are that this will not work!  Don’t be afraid to call a halt at this point and start again.  Take all of the post-it’s you’ve collected so far and put them at the edge of the board so that you don’t forget anything essential but go back to the beginning and be a little more rigorous in your questioning.  Now that the startups have completed their brain-dump you can start to hold them to account more.  You may have to go back to the beginning several times before they understand that you want a linear description of the task, not just a series of random facts.

Startups nearly always (vastly) underestimate the amount of detail required when mapping the problem domain
RenKap… Also, they only tend to consider the jobs etc. that are addressed by their solution.  The jobs/pains/gains they are not targeting are important to understand in order not to over-promise (and disappoint customers) and to create a roadmap for introducing pain relievers/gain creators at a future date.
