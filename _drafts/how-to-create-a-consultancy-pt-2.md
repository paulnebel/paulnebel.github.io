## TL,DR;

It is a commonly held belief that starting a business is a magical process. In order for it to work you need to be that mythical beast known as an *entrepreneur*. The special powers of an entrepreneur enable them to find a fantastic idea that no-one has thought of before, create a marvelous product, release it to the world and viola, success.

For all but a tiny handful of businesses this is completely false.

Starting a business is a process, albeit one shrouded in risk and doubt. I am a Virtual CTO and my job is to reduce the risk and doubt to manageable proportions and guide start-up founders through a process which, while it doesn't guarantee success, certainly makes it more likely.

One of the most important principles of my freelance consultancy, [DogFish Consultants](https://dogfishconsultants.com){:target="_blank"}, is openness. The principals I use and teach are applicable to all types of business, so why not apply them to myself.

That is what this post is about. It is the first in a series that aims to draw back the curtain and tell you exactly how I'm doing what I do.

## A salutary, sorry tale

My current situation is born out of a disaster. I had been working for an eLearning company for eight years. The company was taken over, and the new owners were not to my liking. It was clearly time to get out. Several of my colleagues felt the same way and I took that opportunity to suggest to one of them that we started our own company.  We'd had discussions around the same topic previously.

So that's what we did. And it was a *spectacular* failure, for a number of painfully typical reasons. I did everything wrong.

The initial problem was that the idea for the product we would be creating was not mine, it was my colleague's. This created an imbalance from the start. It meant that I was the lesser partner in the arrangement, and that caused problems later on.

The real issue is that we were a solution in search of a problem, an issue I've seen with a great many start-ups that I've worked with since. We didn't get in the same building as market-product fit, let alone in the same room (this, by the way, is the [number one reason that start-ups fail](https://www.failory.com/blog/startup-mistakes){:target="_blank"}).

The final, compounding issue was that, as nominal CTO, I put my head down and concentrated on playing with technology (which is what I really wanted to do now that I had my freedom) rather than building a product. I have a name for this now: **Comfort Driven Development**. Like so many of my technical compatriots I was so used to building for the sake of building that I forgot to ask what I *should* be building (if anything).

It went swimmingly for the first few months. It's a bit like learning to juggle. When you manage to keep the balls in the air for the first time it's really exciting. You think to yourself "oh my goodness, this is it, I can juggle". It feels great for a couple of seconds. Then one of the balls flies off in the wrong direction. You don't know how to deal with it and all of a sudden all the balls are on the floor.

This is what happened to my putative start-up. I had learned a hard lesson, spent a year of my life creating a pipe dream and it had come to nothing. I had also decided that creating a start-up and working for myself is something that I wanted to do. I just needed to learn how to do it.

## Ding, ding, round two

So I joined [Geoviation](https://geovation.uk){:target="_blank"}. I was employed as a Senior Engineer and Virtual CTO, potentially working with a great many startups using lots of different technologies to help them build their initial products (a point to which I will return later). This was a really excellent opportunity for me to learn what I needed to know to create my own start-up.

I was fortunate to be surrounded by some excellent colleagues, two of whom felt (like me) that we were perhaps not not offering the greatest value to our start-ups in the way we were working at the time. So we decided to create a new way of working.

We started experimenting with different methods and techniques which we had come across, in addition to some new ones that we had found. Together [James](https://productspeoplecareabout.com/about/index.html){:target="_blank"}, [Chris](https://dribbble.com/chris-hall){:target="_blank"} and I ended up creating a process which we felt worked well, based largely on the [Strategyzer](https://www.strategyzer.com/){:target="_blank"} approach.

I spent four and a half years at Geovation perfecting this process, learning how to facilitate workshops, discovering the typical things that start-ups find difficult and getting myself into a position where I felt that I knew what I was doing.

The experience of working with all the different types of start-ups and the problems that they encountered has given me a wealth of examples to draw upon and a way of thinking that has *rewired my brain*.

I really believe this.

Previously I had been like the vast majority of developers, building for the sake of building and wanting to experiment with new technologies. I've now reached a position where I spend most of my time begging startups and not to build *anything*.  The desire to build for the sake of building is one of the key reasons why startups fail and why my start-up failed (among other reasons).

Another thing that became very clear to me, is that there is a mythology surrounding start-ups. The perception is that there is this mythical beast called an entrepreneur. Rather like being an excellent singer, dancer or magician, some people can do it and others can't.

There is a tiny element of truth to that, but actually creating a startup is a process. There is no guarantee of success if you follow the process but your chances of success are greatly increased. This is what I now teach people.

History, as they say, is written by the victors. There are a lot of people who think that Facebook, Instagram, and Slack are examples of businesses that came from nowhere and conquered the world. Don't believe it. They worked to get where they are.

Take [Rovio Entertainment](https://www.rovio.com/){:target="_blank"}, the makers of Angry Birds. Users spend [16 years every hour](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-rovio-made-angry-birds-a-winner){:target="_blank"} playing Angry Birds. Rovio, the company that created it, was close to bankruptcy in 2009. They developed *51 titles* before Angry Birds. Far from coming out of nowhere to instant success, Rovio is a test case of a company that wouldn't give up and stuck to an idea.

Most businesses go through a slog to get to where they are. But as I said, there are processes that can be followed. What I want to do is to remove as much of the mythology and mystique surrounding process as  possible. This is why I'm writing this series of posts to tell you what it is that I'm doing and how I'm doing it to create my own start-up.

## And so it begins

The foundation of my current freelance life was set approximately two years ago when I was given a task by my excellent manager, [Sebastian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovide/){:target="_blank"}. He asked me to write a series of blog posts that would help spread my knowledge and experience to my colleagues and to our community.

It took me about a year of publishing one article a month to find my voice and to become confident and comfortable with what I was saying, but once I got to that point writing new posts became much easier and more fun.

Sebastian had the foresight to offer his team coaching through one of our own start-ups, [Natural Flow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/natural-flow-consultancy/){:target="_blank"}.

In October last year I had a discussion with a Natural Flow coach that basically changed my life. Up to that point I had regarded LinkedIn as something of a personal joke. I joined LinkedIn pretty soon after it started, or at least after it became known. This was approximately 10 years ago. I guess the first 10 or 20 or so contacts that I made were initiated by me.

I rapidly became cynical towards LinkedIn and treated it as a bit of a joke from that point onward. I decided after those first 20 or so contacts that I wasn't going to initiate connections with anyone else. I would wait and see who contacted me, and see how far I got.

I'd picked up around 320 connections in the intervening years, mostly from recruitment consultants. I have known for a long time that networks are important, but I have never encouraged or developed a personal network in the past. In part this is a consequence of my temperament at the time.

What the excellent coach did was to persuade me that I was being *extremely foolish* in taking this approach because, at this point, I had decided that I needed an exit from the Geovation world. My coach made it painfully clear that if I wanted to go freelance then I had to engage with LinkedIn, whether I like it or not.

LinkedIn is absolutely essential tool for marketing oneself as a freelancer in my area of interest. So I made some changes.

**Tidy this up**

Current network: 323 connections
Average monthly profile views: 20-30 (now up to 45, so this is a success)
Average weekly search appearances: 15-25 (most used keyword for search = 'senior software engineer' - I want this to change) (slightly down at 12, but I need to game this a little more. Fail)

Advice from: https://espirian.co.uk/linkedin-starter-guide/

Success = Average monthly profile views > 40 (i.e. 30% increase)

### Open Book
If I find something interesting, I'll share it. I don't hold back information.

While my insights are my own everything else is based on the work of others.  It's not mine to keep.

### Focus Finder
Many business issues arise due to a lack of clarity.

Clarity requires focus, and I help people find the focus that brings clarity.

### Keepin' it real
Business/technology needn't be dull or abstract.

There are plenty of concrete examples out there. Use them.

I have a sense of humour. Use it.

### Building Better Business
Problem first, customer second, solution third.

Always.

### Triple Bottom Line

People and planet before profit.

I have no problem with profit, but it's not an end in itself. If I can help society and the environment by creating a viable business then I've succeeded.

Talk about updating my profile, starting a campaign of publishing blog posts and reaching out to former contacts for endorsements and recommendations.

Sure, quite a proportion (40% ?) of my new page views were from people I'd asked to recommend me, but it also resulted in my first two contracts.

**End of tidy up**


## How did I get here?

Approximately six months ago, things started to change at Geoviation in a way that I wasn't entirely happy with. It's not worth going into the details, but I was intending to leave and set up my own business some time this year. Certain changes occurred at the start of this year that gave me the kick up the backside I needed to make the leap.

I was fortunate that my first contract was with... Geovation, to provide workshops for members one day a week for three months to provide continuity while they look for someone to replace me.

I offered a price lower than my intended fee (but not much lower) because it allowed me to maintain my contact with start-ups. I believe this to be a important thing, as the feedback it provides is invaluable to me. Interestingly, the quality of the enquiries I'm getting has increased dramatically (as I measure it) since I was no longer available 'on tap' but required hub members to book sessions with me online (using Calendly-REFERENCE) at fixed times convenient to me.

Lesson number one: Never be always available because then clients do not value your time (and place less value on the advice you are giving them). Make people have to work, even a little, to see you and it will immediately filter out most of the junk enquiries.

Recognising that continued contact with start-ups is valuable led me to my first course of action, which was to get a list of all the accelerators and incubators in the UK. You can download free this list for free from REFERENCE HERE. Various other organisations that have created their own lists of startup accelerators and incubators, some of which are common to the government list, some of which are additional. I now have a list of accelerators and incubators to apply to as a potential mentor.

I worked my way through this list by picking the accelerators/incubators that seemed most aligned with what I'm selling as a freelance service. I'd signed up to an email newsletter published by Chase Diamond - REFERENCE, a marketing expert who had piqued my interest. I'm wary of email newsletters in general because they seem to evaporate time, but choosing carefully can give good results.

Chase had a video presentation from a friend of his who is an email marketing expert (certainly he's more expert than me!). The long and the short of this presentation was that if you are not yourself an expert the best way to contact potential clients without wasting a great deal of money on, say, Google AdWords was cold emailing. I took his advice, but not literally.

Rather than cold emailing I looked up each accelerator/incubator of interest on LinkedIn and examined the titles of the employees to see who was most likely to respond to a message from someone who wasn't a contact of theirs. I thought that titles similar to 'Programme Manager' would be the best to go for.

I also signed up for a free month trial of LinkedIn Professional which would allow me to cold message 15 people on the platform even if I wasn't connected with them. 15 didn't sound like a lot, but the number of extra messages you get for the next level of subscription didn't seem worth the money so I settled for that.

Given that you got an additional 'extra' message every time someone responded to your initial approach it seemed like a workable strategy. So, I messaged around 15 potential accelerators to see if anyone would be interested. I assumed that I'd have similar success to an SEO campaign, somewhere between 2% and 5%, so I was prepared to have to continue my efforts for a few months before anyone responded positively. I was pleasantly surprised to get a much higher response rate (STATE HOW MUCH).

My initial 15? enquiries generated 4? responses, two of which were negative but which have made me know and have resulted in potential future contacts. Two were positive, and I'm now working with two accelerators, Bloom.Space and 100%Open (LINKS).

Even though I'll probably be working for free for one of those organisations in the short term, we have longer term plans that could lead to paid work. I'm also maintaining my contact with start-ups, which plays into a longer-term strategy on my part because I'm assuming (based on evidence so far) that I'll generate future freelance work from some of these start-ups.

What I'm trying to do is to give myself at least some kind of income stream consistent income stream while I find myself freelance clients, which is a process with a reasonably long tail. So having some sort of consistent income is very important.

My personal niche is start-ups. Ideally, it would be positive impact start-ups, but that kind of filtering may have to wait until I'm more established.  Quite obviously, I need to charge for my services. I consider my services to be extremely valuable. This means that I need to find startups that have at least some money.

When discussing the idea of offering freelance services I've received a lot of positive feedback suggesting that it would be a good idea. Everyone seems to know a star-up that would benefit from my services. The problem is that the kind of start-ups I've been dealing with so far are at the stage where they don't yet have the available cash to be able to afford me.

You can see my prices on this page on my company website. ADD SOME DESCRIPTION OF THE RATIONALE FOR SETTING THESE PRICES, QUOTING FROM DON'T THROW THE DICE.

## I'M HERE

Incidentally, publishing my prices of my consultancy website is also part of the process of being completely open, which is what I intend to be, because if you visit. Pretty much any website out there. You won't find a price mentioned anywhere.

the reason being that likely they are worried that as soon as you see the price. You will walk. And besides that, oh my goodness, that's a lot of money, I can't afford that. Well, I justify the prices that I'm charging on the basis that I honestly believe that I add 10 times more value than the amount that I charge. It's for the end user to decide whether or not that's the case, but I don't see any point in being coy about what I charge because all that will do is end up with a lot of pointless conversations, which lead nowhere because, after you've had the initial discussion. And you mentioned price people suddenly go, oh, no, I don't want that anymore and disappear. That's a waste of everyone's time.

So, I need to I need to find startups that have got money. Some of these, which means I will be concentrating on startups that can receive some form of investment, whether that is from venture capital or employment growth. And since grant recipients are easier to discover that is to say recipients and drugs are easier to discover than the recipient of venture capital investments, my logical place to start is with Innovate UK because they publish lists of all the people who have received grants from them.

And these will form the first set of people to whom I will market myself, but I don't want to market myself, aggressively, I don't think it is particularly appropriate it doesn't fit easily with me and my personality. And I'm not convinced that this is a successful approach. Although, if I'm following at my own dog food. I need to try an aggressive marketing approach as well, and see just how successful that can be. But my intended approach is to contact the recipient of Innovate UK grant funding, and ask them if they would share their experience of how they went about applying for creating their proposal and receiving the grant funds, what it did to them, and their business. When they receive it.

And also find a way on virtual CTO and business advisor.

So it's a kind of soft way of introducing myself, which I'm hoping will work because people like to be asked for their opinion and I want this is a genuine approach. And this isn't simply a mechanism for introducing people to me as a genuine approach because I want to be able to offer my services helping people obtain grants. And I want to write a series of blog posts on it, or at least table posts, and potentially create a couple of podcasts which are further in depth interviews with anyone who will agree to do one with me.

Now in addition to laying the foundation by writing a series of blog posts of which I now have approximately 20. In order to raise my profile on LinkedIn. I have since developing my style and voice gone over all of the blog posts that I wrote. Early on, and updated them all, so that I have a consistent voice added extra detail to them that I've gained. Subsequent to writing them in the first place.

And this is another part of my strategy is to start posting articles on LinkedIn and on medium, Because all the advice that I have read, suggests that posting an article directly on LinkedIn is far more effective than creating a post, which is a link to an article. And so far, that advice appears to be paying out. I was absolutely astonished at the number of views that I've had three posts that I've published so far. And my process at the moment is to take each of those 18 or 20 or so posts that I've already created. On average, one a week.

The next 18 or 20 weeks as a marketing campaign, as it were, on LinkedIn, working pretty well. Also publishing them to medium and tweeting about the posts that I have created. I know, Twitter is also a very important tool just like LinkedIn, my distaste for social media in general, makes it much harder for me to engage on Twitter, but probably something I need to address in the future.

So I'm also fortunate in back together with James and another colleague, a database. When the changes which I spoke earlier were occurring. We spent time analysing our own offerings, which meant we created value propositions for our startups. And the whole point of what I'm doing is to apply the techniques to myself that I recommend to my startups because those techniques are not specific to innovative technology based startups, they can be applied to any startup.

So why can't I apply them to my own consultancy and that's what I intend to do. So I have value propositions. I missed out a step which is the creation of empathy maps and personas. But in the next couple of weeks I will be going back to that step, and doing that very thing step after that is to create a business.

In addition to that, in addition to that, I am conducting experiments, creating tests and learning cards for those experiments. Examples of which are creating a landing page, which has now turned into my company page. Doctors consultants.com I wanted to do this as quickly and cheaply as possible because I needed presence in order to give me some sort of credibility.

So, a true experimental style, I took the quickest and simplest route initially, which was to use a website creator, in this case I use Wix because I have some experience of using that for other people. Just to get something up that represented me in a professional capacity. I only kept that for a couple of weeks because it was very quickly clear to me that Wix is not the platform that I needed to use. So being a developer, I use my own skills to create a new version of that site based on what I have done, which was statically generated to make it as quick and responsive as possible. Am contained more of the details that I've acquired, and was more maintainable, when I did this using 11 Netlify,

My second experiment was to correct a simple feedback form for the participants in my geolocation workshops. I kept this to as few questions as possible, because I know now, The fact is the best way to get any kind of feedback at all. And the point of it was not to be told how fantastic, although that's lovely. And not to be able to get a star rating, like Trustpilot, was actually defined where I am weak, and I wanted to know if people were satisfied with the advice I'd give him. And if they would use me again.

I'd have at least one case the answer The answer to that was No. As a consequence of that. I have studied and published a blog post on the subject of that particular workshop, and I now know how to deal with it, third experiment was contacting the accelerators that I mentioned earlier, and incubators. I expected a typical kind of conversion rate, which you might get from a web landing page that is to say somewhere between two and 5%. But I'm not a marketing expert. And one of the marketing experts that I have signed up to in the newsletter, had a couple of excellent presentations, one of which was about this very subject. And the recommendation there was not to bother with Google ads and things like that. If you're not an expert in marketing, but you use cold emailing.

So that's the approach I took, but now that I'm utilising LinkedIn in the way that it's intended. I got myself a LinkedIn professional accounts, which allow me to send unlimited number of direct messages to people who are not already contacts. And I use this as a mechanism for contacting people that I thought were appropriate in the accelerators and incubate devours mine.

And I'm pleased to say that I got a much higher return rate. Approximately 10% of that return rate. I've had an interview with one accelerator. And we have established a relationship and I am hopeful, we will work together, I have an interview with another one coming up, which I hope will end up the same way. But I am saving the time the over this will be a lot more difficult if I didn't. So whilst I am currently not earning anything close to what I was earning previously. I am at least earning something, and combined with the savings that gives me time to develop my client relationship.

this is where the power of networks have become clear, because I've so far obtained three clients, two of whom are startup that I worked with, one of whom is a startup I have connected with through a connection on LinkedIn. I also work with databases. My next experiment is the ones that I mentioned previously contacting South Africa to receive Innovate UK funding. With regard to interviewing

my ideal situation is to have three monthly contract, contracts, running concurrently, which means that I will be working three days a week, which means the remaining two days for contingency and for working with accelerators for developing my own product which I have a couple. You can see them here (add reference).

And for general investigation, and blogging, and possibly creation of a newsletter. That's where I'm at right now. I can publish a series of posts, like this one about my experiences so far for a number of reasons. First is that I want to dispel the myths surrounding start-ups, there's a lot of information out there that tells you what to do, but not how to do it, but I want to change that is, I've got a feeling, a blog post on this particular subject. I got to be more popular by orders of magnitude than my other blog posts. So as a means of raising my profile.

I just want to share, and I welcome your experience, if you've done anything similar, or are intending to do anything so if you can contact me here. I'm also concentrating on positive impact.

I'll also be telling you some of the tools and techniques that I use. For example, this particular blog post was largely written as I was out dictating to my phone on my daily walk exercise. I'll tell you how in a future blog post.

An excellent example of the kind of openness, I'm talking about, can be found on David Lynch's blog. And this has been something of an inspiration to me.

In order to be a successful consultant. People need to know first and foremost that you exist. That has been the focus of my work so far. Raising my LinkedIn profile, so that people know that I am there. And what I am capable.

It was pretty clear to me that my longevity, as a developer was Unlimited, not least because of my age, and therefore the amount I need to charge, but also because there are lots of much cheaper, much younger, also being much faster, developers out there who could easily undercut me. So when I recognised that I needed to develop new skills associated skills because I didn't want to ditch everything that I've done up until this point. That would be silly, but new skills, that put me in a position where I didn't have so much competition. When in fact, where I have very little competition.

## The take-away
