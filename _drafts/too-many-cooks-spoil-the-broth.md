# Too many cooks spoil the broth

It is vitally important to limit the number of participants in a VP session.  Preferably no more than 3. There are two main problems with too many people. The first is that they donâ€™t play nicely (talk over each other, disagree, spend ages reaching consensus).  The second is that, even if they play nicely it is too easy to be dragged off the point.  E.g. Trusted Data Hub: when asking questions with the intention of clarifying a point it is too easy for other people to jump in and qualify the answer being given, which often ends up dragging the facilitator away from the point causing them to forget what they were asking.  Also, end up arguing amongst themselves rather than answering a point.
