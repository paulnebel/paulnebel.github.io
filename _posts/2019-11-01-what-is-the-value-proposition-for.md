## TL;DR;

The [Strategyzer Value Proposition Canvas](https://assets.strategyzer.com/assets/resources/the-value-proposition-canvas-instruction-manual.pdf){:target="_blank"} is one of the first tools that I use when working with start-ups.  It's an incredibly important tool because it is a great way to establish whether you have achieved Problem/Solution fit.  Although I mainly use it for it's intended outcome there are some other very good reasons for running a Value Proposition session, as described below.

## What, exactly, are you doing and who are you doing it for?

I consider a Value Propsition (VP) session to be something of a necessity when I work with start-ups.  Founders sometimes object to this on the basis that they have already created a VP Canvas. However, *I* still need to understand their business if I am to offer appropriate help, and the VP is the best way I have found of doing this.

Creating a VP Canvas by and for yourself is a tricky business. The temptation to ignore difficulties is very high, as is the tendency to give responses that are too abstract.  It's hard work (and often quite boring!) to have to examine the smallest elements of everything you are doing but the devil, as they say, is in the detail.  In this case, the devil is often the *actual* problem your potential customer is experiencing.

## Does it really matter?

I certainly believe it does.  I'll give you an example.  I was working with a company who had conducted an investigation phase which included something they described as a VP.  Following this, they had spent a year and Â£2.5m creating a solution for a very large customer only to find that the customer didn't want it! In fact, the customer had 'disappeared'.  They weren't responding to calls or emails.

They asked me to take a look at what they'd done to see if I could help.  The product essentially consisted of a data set, which is what their customer had said they wanted. The issue was that the company I was advising was used to creating data sets, but not so used to creating products. The consequence of this is that when running their VP session they'd concentrated on what they knew - the data set - rather than on the related pains that the customer was experiencing.

When they did finally manage to make contact they discovered that the customer was already struggling with the 800 or so other data sets that they had yet to ingest into their systems (you read that right - 800 datasets!).  Needless to say, they were somewhat unhappy at having to deal with - and pay for - the 801st data set, no matter how useful it might have been to them.

It didn't take long to realise that in the initial VP session was flawed because they didn't look in detail at the jobs the customer had to undertake, one them being to ingest many data sets.  Associated with this job was the considerable pain of the time it took to import this data.  My suggestion was that rather than simply creating a data set they could also create a tool for inputting that data into the customer's systems with the least effort possible.  They now have a happy customer!

## Establish that there is a problem to be solved

The majority of startups I support are solution-led in the beginning, rather than problem-led.

There are many reasons why people leave their jobs to start their own business.  High among the list of motivations is that they want to solve a problem that they themselves have encountered.  This is a very good reason for considering starting a business, but only if you're sure that:

 1. There are enough (or, indeed, *any*) other people/businesses in the world that have encountered the same problem.
 2. This problem is causing these other people/businesses sufficient pain that they will pay to resolve it.
 3. No-one else is already solving the problem, or if they are then your proposed solution is at least 10 times better than the solutions currently being offered.

We often find that the entrepreneur believes (s)he has identified an opportunity and has leapt immediately to a solution without asking these questions.  Don't get me wrong - they may well have identified an opportunity.  The question is whether the solution is desirable (someone will pay for it), feasible (we can build it) and viable (it makes more money per customer than it costs per cusomer).

The most sensible place to start is with desirability, since if no-one wants to pay for it then the feasibility and viability don't matter - at least in 95% of cases.

## Get the right tools for the job

It is often the case that entrepreneurs don't have answers to some or any of the questions above simply because they don't have any techniques for finding the answers. This is where I can help.  There are at least two other common reasons that explain why no answers have been sought and I can help with these too.

The first is that the entrepreneur just wants to do a *thing*.  They've wanted to do the *thing* for some time and have finally found an opportunity to do it.  They know how to do the *thing*, they're good at it and they want to do it some more. In an ideal world they'd sit in a darkened room and just do the *thing*, present it to the world and find they have a business.

I call this **Comfort Driven Development** because feels good. It's familiar. All the other things that should be done are hard and unknown and scary.  Unfortunately, it is usually these hard, unknown, scary things that they should actualy be doing.  This is one of the benefits I can bring - helping entrepreneurs do the things they don't want to do!

The second reason is that they know how their problem affects them and they assume that it affects everyone else the same way.  In consequence, they throw themselves into providing a solution without fully exploring the problem.  Even if there are other people who share the same problem it is important to remember that *you are not your user*.  Just because you like your proposed solution that doesn't mean anyone else will.

Also, it is important to understand what parts of a potential problem you are not solving.  This helps manage users' expectations (and ensure that they are not disapppointed in your product/service) and also identifies potential areas for future business development or pivoting.

## The takeaway

The point of the Value Proposition is to understand what your customer needs and how your proposed solution addresses those needs.

> The ideal result of the Value Proposition is **clarity** of purpose and intent, which are the pre-requisites for efficient execution.

If you've done it before the worst outcome is that doing it again will be faster.  The best outcome is that, by being independent and ignorant of your thought processes, a facilitator can strengthen your proposition and add important detail that would otherwise be missing.
