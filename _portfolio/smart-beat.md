[SmartBeat®](https://smartbeat.herokuapp.com/){:target='_blank'} is a rhythm game that challenges players to decode a visual sequence into an acoustic pattern. The motivation behind SmartBeat® came from the desire to develop a musically-based educational resource which would be fun whilst also building core cognitive skills. The essence of SmartBeat® is simple enough to be learnt by anyone, regardless of their age, cultural background or educational level.

The activity requires the coordination of visual, auditory and motor skills; these are the three main sensory receivers involved with perception and memory and we are said to learn best when these modalities are used in combination.

SmartBeat® is currently under development, being re-written in Gatsby.js and React from an original version written with C# and WPF.
