[ChordFlow](https://chord-flow.dogfishmusic.co.uk){:target='_blank'} is a game for musicians to test their knowledge of musical chords.  It presents a series of chords for the musician to play along with, helping them become fluent at changing from one chord to another. For each chord, it shows the symbol, stave representation and keyboard keys to help when you get stuck or are learning.

ChordFlow is currently in being tested in beta. It uses the following technologies:

 - Gatsby.js (backend static site builder)
 - React.js (frontend templates)
 - Bulma.css (frontend styling)
