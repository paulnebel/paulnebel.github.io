[Building Passport](https://www.buildingpassport.com/){:target="_blank"} was born in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire in the UK. On the 14th of June 2017 a fire broke out which consumed the tower block, killing 72 people. [Rupert Parker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupertparkerlondon){:target="_blank"}, Building Passport's founder and CEO, decided that he wanted to help prevent such a disaster from ever happening again.

He created a repository for all data related to properties, starting with floorplans, so that all building information can be stored, organised and shared in one place.

In addition, Rupert has worked with the [UK Fire Service](https://www.fireservice.co.uk/){:target="_blank"} to make sure that, by using Building Passport, they can access all the information relating to a particular building in the case of an emergency. This greatly improves the ability of Fire Fighters to understand and safely deal with such emergencies in a way that was not possible previously.

## Engagement (June 2021 - April 2022)

Rupert recognised that if building managers are to have confidence in his data store it was important to ensure that all steps have been taken to ensure the security of that data.

Paul was contracted to conduct a security assessment of the application software, hosting infrastructure and general working practices of Building Passport to ensure that all reasonable steps are being made to secure the data held. Building Passport is currently working towards [Cyber Essentials Accreditation](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview){:target="_blank"} with a view to implementing [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html){:target="_blank"} in the future.

Paul is making sure that this accreditation is achieved, as well as acting in a general CTO role for Building Passport on a day-to-day basis.
