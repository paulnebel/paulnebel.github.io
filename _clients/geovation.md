[Geovation](https://geovation.uk/){:target="_blank"} is the open innovation centre for [Ordnance Survey (OS)](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}, the UK's national mapping service.

Geovation is a start-up hub which runs Geotech and Proptech Accelerator Programmes on behalf of both OS and [Her Majesty's Land Registry](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry){:target="_blank"} (HMLR) respectively.

## Engagement (April 2021 - September 2022)

Paul worked for Geovation for 5 years as a Senior Engineer. In that time, together with colleagues James Gardner and [Chris Hall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisdhall){:target="_blank"}, Paul developed the tools and workshops used by the Geovation Programme to help start-ups on their journey. While at Geovation Paul assisted over 100 start-ups from a variety of different industries including safety, transport, proptech, cleantech, energy, agriculture, fitness and smart cities.

Paul left Geovation in April 2021 to pursue a career as a Freelance Fractional CTO offering technical leadership and business advice. Since then he has been asked to continue running 'Ask Me Anything' workshops for Geovation Hub Members. In addition, Paul has been asked to interview candidates for the last four Geovation Programme cohorts and to run Value Proposition sessions with the successful start-ups.
