[Urban Intelligence (UI)](https://urbanintelligence.co.uk/) uses ground-breaking geospatial analysis techniques to transform the way that the world identifies and assesses land and property.

## Engagement (October 2021 - present)

[Dan Mohamed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danmohamed) contacted Paul following the departure of his lead developer. UI is not a technology company as such but it relies on technology to deliver data, which is its core Intellectual Property.

The loss of his development lead left Dan in need of technical leadership, which Paul has provided.

Paul's core activities as Fractional CTO so far have been to:

- Rationalise the existing product code-base to eliminate technical debt.
- Harden the security of the product and the cloud infrastructure to support Penetration Testing.
- Plan product development to enhance the company strategy.
- Engage with and manage a 3rd-party development team to enhance delivery.
- Mentor the junior developers and create an effective team.
