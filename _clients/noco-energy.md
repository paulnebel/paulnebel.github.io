[NOCO Energy (NE)](https://www.nocoenergy.co.uk/) is a data platform facilitating investment in renewable energy for businesses and developers, fostering a low carbon future.

## Engagement (October 2021 - present)

[Calin Basno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/calinbasno) contacted Paul following the departure of his co-founder, who was also his technical lead. NE is not a technology company as such but it relies on technology to deliver data, which is its core Intellectual Property.

The loss of his co-founder left Calin in need of technical leadership, which Paul has provided.

Paul's core activities as Fractional CTO so far have been to:

- Recover and rationalise the existing product code-base to provide a stable platform going forward.
- Expand the product to provide an API.
- Plan product development to enhance the company strategy.
- Mentor the junior developers and data scientists and create an effective team.
