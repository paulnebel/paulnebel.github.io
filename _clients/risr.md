[risr/](https://risr.global) is a unified platform that enables organisations to apply, assess and advance their users' training and CPD needs. It offers three modules: risr/apply, risr/assess and risr/advance, supported by a single expert team and is trusted by leading medical universities and royal colleges.

## Engagement (January 2023 - present)

Paul joined the risr/ team to help improve infrastructure implementation and costs. This is an ongoing task.
